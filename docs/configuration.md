# Configuration

The container is configured through environment variables. The model profile baked into an image is only a startup default; runtime variables can override it.

## Runtime

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RUN_MODE` | `worker`, `local-api`, or `pod`. | `worker` |
| `SERVE_API_LOCALLY` | Legacy fallback to `local-api` when `RUN_MODE` is unset. | `false` |
| `LTX_FRONTEND_ENABLED` | Start the bundled frontend on port `7777`. | `true` |
| `PUBLIC_KEY` | Optional SSH public key. When set, SSH starts in the container. | unset |
| `COMFY_LOG_LEVEL` | ComfyUI log level. | `DEBUG` |

`worker` starts ComfyUI, the frontend, and the RunPod serverless handler. `local-api` replaces the RunPod worker loop with a local compatible API on port `8000`. `pod` starts ComfyUI and the frontend without a handler.

## LTX 2.5 preload

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LTX25_PRELOAD_VARIANT` | Startup model profile. Supported value: `distilled-int8`; empty disables preload. | image default |
| `LTX25_PRELOAD_PROMPT_ENHANCER` | Download the Gemma 4 prompt enhancer when a profile is enabled. | `true` |
| `LTX25_DOWNLOAD_BACKEND` | `auto`, `hf_hub`, or `wget`. | `auto` |
| `HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Hugging Face read token used for gated downloads. `HF_TOKEN` and `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` are accepted aliases. | unset |

Accept the [LTX 2.5 model terms](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2.5) before first boot. A token is required while the gated files are missing; an already-populated persistent volume does not need to redownload them.

Recommended serverless values:

```env
PERSIST_WORKSPACE=true
RUN_MODE=worker
COMFY_NODES=127.0.0.1:8188
LTX25_PRELOAD_VARIANT=distilled-int8
LTX25_PRELOAD_PROMPT_ENHANCER=true
HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN=hf_xxx
```

## Persistent workspace

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PERSIST_WORKSPACE` | Persist ComfyUI, the venv, caches, workflows, and models. | `true` |
| `WORKSPACE_ROOT` | Override the detected persistent root. | `/workspace` when available |
| `WORKSPACE_STATE_ROOT` | Persisted ComfyUI/venv/cache state directory. | `<WORKSPACE_ROOT>/worker-comfyui` |
| `COMFY_BOOTSTRAP_REFRESH_CUSTOM_NODES` | Comma-separated baked node directories refreshed during bootstrap. | `ComfyUI-Downloader` |
| `COMFY_BOOTSTRAP_WORKFLOWS` | Comma-separated baked workflows copied into the persisted ComfyUI user directory. | `video_ltx2_5_i2v_API.json` |
| `BOOTSTRAP_PROGRESS_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` | Interval for long seed-operation progress logs. | `15` |
| `BOOTSTRAP_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Maximum wait for the shared bootstrap lock. | `600` |
| `BOOTSTRAP_LOCK_POLL_SECONDS` | Shared-lock polling interval. | `2` |
| `BOOTSTRAP_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS` | Age at which an unrefreshed lock is considered stale. | `120` |
| `BOOTSTRAP_LOCK_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` | Lock timestamp refresh interval. | `5` |

On Serverless, RunPod mounts a network volume at `/runpod-volume`; startup aliases it to `/workspace`. Multiple workers sharing a volume coordinate first-boot seeding with `/workspace/worker-comfyui/.bootstrap.lock`.

| Purpose | Path |
| --- | --- |
| ComfyUI code and user state | `/workspace/worker-comfyui/comfyui` |
| Python virtualenv | `/workspace/worker-comfyui/venv` |
| Download/compiler caches | `/workspace/worker-comfyui/cache` |
| Models | `/workspace/models` |
| Handler input/output | `/comfyui/input`, `/comfyui/output` |
| Extra model path configuration | `/comfyui/extra_model_paths.yaml` |

ComfyUI Manager is forced to offline mode at every boot. Install custom nodes in the image; runtime Manager installs are intentionally unavailable.

## Handler and ComfyUI

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COMFY_NODES` | Comma-separated ComfyUI API hosts used by the handler. | `127.0.0.1:8188` |
| `LOCAL_COMFY_NODE` | ComfyUI host used by the bundled frontend. | `127.0.0.1:8188` |
| `COMFY_INPUT_DIR` | Uploaded workflow input staging directory. | `/comfyui/input` |
| `COMFY_OUTPUT_DIR` | Generated artifact pickup directory. | `/comfyui/output` |
| `COMFYUI_MANAGER_CONFIG` | Manager `config.ini` updated during startup. | `/comfyui/user/__manager/config.ini` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis used for dedupe, job status, rate limits, and circuit-breaker state. | `redis://localhost:6379` |
| `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Successful response cache lifetime in seconds. | `604800` |
| `MAX_INLINE_VIDEO_MB` | Maximum inline video response size before S3 becomes mandatory. | `50` |
| `INDRO_API_KEY` | Authentication for the legacy `prompt` + `image_url` path only. | `dev_token_123` |

## S3 artifact uploads

When `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` is unset, artifacts are returned inline as base64. When it is set, the handler uploads artifacts with `boto3` and returns presigned URLs.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` | Bucket used for generated artifacts. Enables S3 mode. |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key ID with `s3:PutObject` access. |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Matching secret access key. |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | Bucket region. |

Example workflow response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "output": {
    "videos": [
      {
        "filename": "LTX-2.5_i2v.mp4",
        "type": "url",
        "data": "https://example-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/job-123/00-LTX-2.5_i2v.mp4?...",
        "media_type": "video/mp4"
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "render_time_sec": 42.1,
    "node_used": "127.0.0.1:8188"
  }
}
```
