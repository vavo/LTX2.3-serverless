# Deployment

Deploy the CUDA 13.0 LTX 2.5 image as the primary path. Keep the CUDA 12.8 tag only for environments where the cu130 image cannot run.

## 1. Build and publish

The repository does not prove that any public image tag has already been published. Build and push to a registry you control:

```bash
docker buildx bake ltx2-5-distilled-int8 \
  --set 'ltx2-5-distilled-int8.tags=<registry>/<image>:<version>-ltx2.5-distilled-int8-cu130' \
  --push
```

Fallback target:

```bash
docker buildx bake ltx2-5-distilled-int8-cu128 \
  --set 'ltx2-5-distilled-int8-cu128.tags=<registry>/<image>:<version>-ltx2.5-distilled-int8-cu128' \
  --push
```

The bake file pins `linux/amd64`. If you use `docker build` directly, specify `--platform linux/amd64`; images built natively on Apple Silicon will not become RunPod-compatible through positive thinking.

## 2. Create a Serverless template

Create a Serverless template in the RunPod console and set:

- Container image: the fully qualified tag pushed above.
- Runtime command: leave the image default unchanged.
- Registry credentials: configure them only for a private registry.
- Environment: use the first-boot values below.
- Container disk: size for the image and temporary runtime data; keep model weights on a network volume.

```env
PERSIST_WORKSPACE=true
RUN_MODE=worker
COMFY_NODES=127.0.0.1:8188
LTX25_PRELOAD_VARIANT=distilled-int8
LTX25_PRELOAD_PROMPT_ENHANCER=true
HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN=hf_xxx
```

Accept the [LTX 2.5 license](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2.5) before booting the template.

## 3. Create the endpoint

Create a queue-based Serverless endpoint from the template:

- Start with one GPU per worker.
- Prioritize a Blackwell GPU compatible with the CUDA 13 image.
- Start at 48 GB VRAM for the distilled INT8 workflow; validate memory use with the exact resolution, duration, and node graph before production.
- Attach at least 100 GB of persistent network storage for the default weights and caches.
- Start with one worker until first-boot preload completes, then configure scaling.
- Set execution timeout above the measured render time of the longest supported request.

RunPod mounts Serverless volumes at `/runpod-volume`; this worker aliases that path to `/workspace`. Current RunPod settings and GPU choices are documented in the [endpoint settings](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/endpoint-configurations) and [network volumes](https://docs.runpod.io/storage/network-volumes) guides.

## 4. Smoke test

Use the checked-in [`video_ltx2_5_i2v_API.json`](../video_ltx2_5_i2v_API.json) and the request shape in the [README](../README.md#api-contract). Verify:

1. Bootstrap reports the persisted LTX stack as ready.
2. ComfyUI starts without missing-node or missing-model errors.
3. `/health` responds.
4. `/runsync` completes a small I2V job.
5. The response contains `output.videos[]` and the file is decodable.
6. A second worker boot reuses the persisted state instead of downloading weights again.

The repository test suite validates configuration and workflow transformation without a GPU. It is not a substitute for this smoke test.

## Image and API compatibility

| Target | CUDA | Tag suffix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base` | 13.0.2 | `<version>-base` |
| `base-cuda12-8-1` | 12.8.1 | `<version>-base-cuda12.8.1` |
| `ltx2-5-distilled-int8` | 13.0.2 | `<version>-ltx2.5-distilled-int8-cu130` |
| `ltx2-5-distilled-int8-cu128` | 12.8.1 | `<version>-ltx2.5-distilled-int8-cu128` |

New clients should send `input.workflow` plus optional `input.images`. The older `input.prompt`, `input.image_url`, and `input.api_key` route remains only for compatibility. Audio can participate in the bundled LTX workflow, but the handler currently exposes only image and video artifact collections.

## Pod mode

For a persistent Pod instead of Serverless, use the same image and model volume with:

```env
PERSIST_WORKSPACE=true
RUN_MODE=pod
LOCAL_COMFY_NODE=127.0.0.1:8188
LTX25_PRELOAD_VARIANT=distilled-int8
LTX25_PRELOAD_PROMPT_ENHANCER=true
HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN=hf_xxx
```

Pod mode starts ComfyUI on `8188` and the frontend on `7777`, and skips the RunPod serverless handler.
